# Smart Plant Growing System

Welcome to the Smart Plant Growing System project! This repository contains the code and documentation for creating a smart growing system with an integrated irrigation system and a machine learning algorithm for plant disease recognition.

## Overview

The Smart Plant Growing System aims to optimize plant care by using advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Home Assistant, Edge Impulse, ESP32, and Arduino. This system automates irrigation, amount of light and monitors plant health, providing a comprehensive solution for efficient and effective plant growth management.

## Features

- **Automated Irrigation System**: Ensures plants receive the right amount of water.
- **Automated Light System**: Ensures plants receive the right amount of light.
- **Plant Disease Recognition**: Uses machine learning algorithms to detect plant diseases.
- **IoT Integration**: Utilizes IoT devices and sensors for real-time monitoring.
- **Home Assistant Integration**: Allows for easy management and monitoring of the system.
- **Energy management with solar powered system**: Ensures that system uses renewable energy sources and lets user to manage ESP32 sleep modes.
